Tested on vivaldi version **4.2**

A simple modern ui that incorporates many style ideas of popular browsers like chrome and firefox.

* It introduces more padding to most of the standard vivaldi components making it look less cramped.
* Menu items are moved to the right side to make it easier for new people to adjust to the browser.


## Installation

The style can be applied via the custom ui modification settings of vivaldi. Since this feature is considered
to be experimental it needs to be enabled first.

1. Open **vivaldi://experiments/** and enable "Allow using custom css modifications".
2. Download the modern-ui.css and move it to a custom folder.
3. Open Vivaldi Settings -> Appearance -> Custom UI Modifications.
4. Select the folder you chose in step 2.
5. Restart the browser.
